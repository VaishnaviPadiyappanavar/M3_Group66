## Introduction:
An induction motor is an AC Electric motor in which the electric current in the rotor needed
to produce torque is obtained by electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of the stator
winding.Induction motors are widely used in Industries.The torque-speed characteristic is required in order to predict behavior of induction machines in electrical motor drives and hence modelling of Induction motor is done to determine torque speed characteristics.
